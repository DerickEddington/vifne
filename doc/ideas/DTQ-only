[The Ready Tasks Queue of Vifne is the analog of the Deferred Tasks Queue of
Fresh Breeze.]

To keep the emulator simple and focused on higher-level exploration, the
Deferred Tasks Queue could be the only way that processors get new tasks.
Unlike the F.B. design which also has Active Task List and Pending Task Queue
and algorithms for when to steal from another processor's PTQ or when to get
from the DTQ and an inter-processor network for communicating.

Having only a DTQ will not change the semantics from the software's perspective,
I think, because in the F.B. design tasks might be taken from the DTQ at any
time.  The software will see spawn and join semantics the same as if there was
also PTQ (and ATL) involved. (Right?)
