Vifne is an emulator of the Fresh Breeze computer architecture designed by Jack
B. Dennis.  It is intended for exploring programming such a computer, and it
does not emulate all aspects of a real hardware machine.  It does emulate
... TODO.  It differs from the Fresh Breeze design, as described in the
freely-available papers, in some ways ... TODO.  Vifne means fresh in the Lojban
language and is pronounced TODO: international phonetic symbols.

TODO: More about the file collection and how to use it.
