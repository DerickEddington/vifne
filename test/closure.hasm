TODO: Make an I.S. that takes an I.S. and an index and a field-value, and copies
the I.S. with the field-value substituted at the index.  This enables taking a
closure template and filling in the needed fields with whatever closed-over
values.  Note that this is nearly the same as a general array-tree update
procedure, the only difference being that I.S. are a handle on an array-tree
rather than an array-tree directly.  Perhaps, instead, the test should be of
array-tree updating first, and then a secondary test of using it for closure
instantiation.

; Nothing to return to, so done.
