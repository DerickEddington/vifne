There will be a scheme-script program named vifne, that takes optional
command-line arguments, that starts the emulator by mmap'ing the storage file(s)
and resuming the emulated system's execution from where it left off.

The main storage file will be named shared-chunk-storage, and will be found in
the current directory, by default.

There maybe should be a CL-arg for the number of processors to emulate, which
means the number of Posix processes to fork to act as processors.  TODO: There
might be difficulties with resuming a system with a different number of
processors than it ran on the previous time, so maybe this option shouldn't
exist and the number of processors will be hard-coded in the
shared-chunk-storage.
