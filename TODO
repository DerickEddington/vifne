? How to close and unlink message queues?  How to clean-up all resources across
the multiple processes?

Need to be careful about deadlocking the SMS or a processor because of
message-queue operations blocking.  What if the SMS replies to a processor but
the processor's message queue is full - the SMS will block until the processor
removes a message, unless the MQs are made non-blocking.  But non-blocking MQs
requires buffering unsent messages and coordinating/scheduling retrying to send
unsent messages - very different than real hardware.  Is it possible to make
this dataflow system, via communication with MQs, determinate such that deadlock
is impossible?  I think I'll wait until I have an initial system running, to see
how these issues might happen.

I suspect that the SMS process should have a higher host-OS scheduling priority
than the processor processes, so it can keep up with the amount of requests.

Does an Interprocessor Network need to exist, so the processors can communicate
things such as supplying a join result to an activity on another processor?  If
so, I suppose it should use Posix message queues.
